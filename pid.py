    PID controllers are advanced ways to control 
    the input of a signal based on the output.

    P is a proportional output based on the error to the target value 
        and can function on its own (albeit not perfectly)
    I is the additive history of error (integral) and decreases response time
    D is the rate of change (derivative) of the input towards the target value
        and acts as a damper 

    The combination of P, I, and D values are modified by their respective gain
        values, and their sum is converted into the input signal. This signal 
        may be clamped by a set of simple comparisons based on physical or 
        design constraints. A perfectly tuned PID will rapidly approach the 
        target value without overshooting the value (increasing the error). 
        The designer may opt for a more rapid approach with acceptable overshoot, 
        or vice versa, by tuning the proper PID values.
    
    Control theory on choosing gain values intelligently, knowing whether the 
        gain values will produce a stable output, and in general smarter design 
        and implementation is based on the dynamics of the system.
